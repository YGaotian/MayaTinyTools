Here are some tools I wrote for my projects or friends, some of them were quickly written in a few hours.
这是一些我为自己的项目或朋友们写的小工具，相当一部分是在几个小时内快速写出来的，不保证绝对的质量，但够用。

Unlawful use of my code is prohibited

Also, do not use my code if your project contains violent, religious, political, or pornographic contents.
别把我的代码用在会令人厌恶的事情上。

If you have no idea about how to use some of my tool, just glance at the beginning of the source code of the tool you want to use, and you may find something helpful!
如果有不会用的工具，记得看一看你想用的工具的代码的开头，一般应该会有写一个Usage，如果看不懂英文，不妨谷歌或有道翻译一下
